<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Discard your inefficient credit card spending!
#
Discard is a webapp built to help users manage their credit cards and maximize cashback rewards. Using a database of all Canadian credit cards and cashback deals from Rakuten, Discard can tell you the best credit card to use based on your shopping needs with a sleek and responsive UI. 
#
Simply login to Discard with Google and add your cards to the app. You can then use the search function to find a store or directly use your location with Google Maps to find nearby stores. Discard will then use its large database of credit cards and deals to select the best card to use from your set of cards. Just like that, you'll be set to maximize your cashback rewards!

**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`
